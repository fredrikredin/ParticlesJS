### About p5.js

> "p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! ... Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound."
